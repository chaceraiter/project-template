# AI Agent Orientation - Start Here

Welcome! You are being onboarded to a new project that uses an AI context system. This system is designed to solve the common problem of context loss between AI chat sessions.

## Directory Structure Overview

This project uses a structured approach to maintain context across conversations. Here's what everything means:

### `project-setup/` - Foundational Documents (Set Once)

**`agent-operating-rules.md`** - Your core operating principles for this project. This defines how you should communicate, what standards to follow, workflow preferences, and red lines you must never cross. These rules should be kept in mind throughout all interactions.

**`project-vision-and-goals.md`** - The big picture of what we're building and why. This explains the project's purpose, target users, success criteria, and long-term direction.

**`project-architecture.md`** - The technical architecture, technology stack, system design, and key architectural patterns. This provides the technical foundation for understanding how the system is built.

**`code-patterns-and-conventions.md`** - Established code patterns, naming conventions, and coding standards specific to this project. Follow these patterns when writing code.

### `current-work/` - Active Context (Updated Frequently)

**`current-work-focus.md`** - A 3-5 sentence summary with three levels of focus. The **Project Goal** describes the high-level vision of what we're building (the big picture). The **Intermediate Goal** specifies the current phase or milestone we're working toward (medium-term). The **Current Task** states exactly what is being worked on right now (immediate focus). This hierarchical structure helps you quickly understand where we are in the overall journey.

**`current-context-for-new-chat.md`** - A living document with the current state of the project. What's working, what's broken, active issues, recent changes. This should be updated regularly as work progresses.

### `past-chat-record/` - Historical Archive

This directory contains archived summaries from previous AI chat sessions. Each file should be dated and include key decisions, code written, and problems solved. This serves as the project's memory.

## Your Instructions

Now that you understand the structure, please follow these steps **in order**:

### Step 1: Setup Agent Operating Rules
Ask the user to help you fill out `project-setup/agent-operating-rules.md`. This is crucial for establishing how you should work together. Ask questions about:
- Communication style preferences (concise vs. detailed, when to ask vs. proceed)
- Code quality standards (testing requirements, documentation expectations)
- Workflow guidelines (git practices, which files to update when)
- Red lines (what you should never do without explicit permission)

### Step 2: Understand the Project
With the user's help, gather information to populate the `project-setup/` files:
- What is the project's vision and goals? (`project-vision-and-goals.md`)
- What is the technical architecture and tech stack? (`project-architecture.md`)
- What code patterns and conventions should be followed? (`code-patterns-and-conventions.md`)

Ask clarifying questions to understand the project deeply.

### Step 3: Explain the Active Context System
Explain to the user how the `current-work/` directory works:
- `current-work-focus.md` should be updated whenever the focus shifts to a new task or phase
- `current-context-for-new-chat.md` should be updated regularly (ideally at the end of each session or when significant changes occur) to capture the current state

### Step 4: Explain the Archive System
Explain to the user how the `past-chat-record/` directory works:
- At the end of significant chat sessions, save a summary of what was accomplished
- Name files with dates (e.g., `2025-10-12-implemented-auth-system.md`)
- Include key decisions, code changes, and outstanding issues

### Step 5: Request Permission for Emphatic Reminder
Ask the user if you may add a very emphatic plea/reminder to `agent-operating-rules.md` about the importance of keeping these context files updated. Something that will ensure future AI agents (including yourself in new chats) actually use this system rather than letting it fall into disrepair.

## If You're Losing Context

If the user directed you to this file because you seem to be losing context or forgetting project details:

1. **Re-read** `project-setup/agent-operating-rules.md` - Remember your operating principles
2. **Re-read** `current-work/current-work-focus.md` - Reorient yourself to what we're working on
3. **Re-read** `current-work/current-context-for-new-chat.md` - Catch up on the current state
4. **Scan** `past-chat-record/` - Review recent session summaries if needed

The user sent you here to review the project structure and your operating rules. Take a moment to read the relevant files before continuing.
