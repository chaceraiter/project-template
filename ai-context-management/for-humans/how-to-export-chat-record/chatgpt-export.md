# Exporting Chats from ChatGPT

First read `record-format-standard.md` in this folder.

## Method 1: Copy Individual Conversation (Most Practical)
1. Open the conversation you want to save
2. Use available Share/Export actions, or copy-paste manually
3. Save to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/`
4. Use filename format from `record-format-standard.md`

## Method 2: Built-In Account Export (Bulk)
1. Open ChatGPT settings and look for Data Export
2. Request/export account data
3. Extract the specific conversation needed
4. Save selected content to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/` using standard naming

## Method 3: Structured Summary (Fallback)
Use this when you cannot capture a clean transcript:
1. Write a structured summary using required sections in `record-format-standard.md`
2. Save it to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/` with standard naming

## After Export

Follow the required post-export updates in `record-format-standard.md` so current context stays accurate.
