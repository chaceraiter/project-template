# Exporting Chats from Cursor

## Method 1: Copy-Paste (Simple)
1. In Cursor, select all text in the chat window (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A)
2. Copy (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)
3. Create a new file in `past-chat-record/` with today's date
4. Paste the full conversation
5. Save the file

## Method 2: Export Feature (if available)
Check if Cursor has a built-in export feature:
- Look for an export button in the chat interface
- Check Settings → Chat → Export options
- Right-click in chat window for context menu options

## Method 3: Use Cursor's API/Extensions
[TODO: Research if Cursor provides export APIs or extensions]

## Tips
- Export significant sessions at the end of each work day
- Include the full conversation, not just summaries
- If the chat is very long, consider splitting into multiple files by topic
