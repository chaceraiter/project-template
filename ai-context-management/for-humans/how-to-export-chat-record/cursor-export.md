# Exporting Chats from Cursor

First read `record-format-standard.md` in this folder.

## Method 1: Copy-Paste Transcript (Most Common)
1. In Cursor chat, select all visible messages (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A)
2. Copy (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)
3. Create a file in `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/`
4. Use filename format from `record-format-standard.md`
5. Paste and save

## Method 2: Built-In Export (If Available)
1. Check Cursor chat UI for Export/Share actions
2. Export the conversation
3. Save it to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/` with standard naming

## Method 3: Structured Summary (Fallback)
Use this when full export is unavailable or too noisy:
1. Write a structured summary using the required sections in `record-format-standard.md`
2. Save to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/` with standard naming

## After Export

Follow the required post-export updates in `record-format-standard.md` so current context stays accurate.
