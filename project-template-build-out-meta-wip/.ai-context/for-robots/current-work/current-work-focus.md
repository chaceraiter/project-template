# Current Work Focus

We are building an AI context system (starter pack) for vibe coding / AI-assisted development. The primary goal is to solve the pain points of context loss between AI chat sessions, eliminating the need to manually paste summaries, and maintaining project awareness across conversations.

- **Project Goal:** Create a tool-agnostic folder structure with documentation files that any AI agent can read to quickly understand a project's context, goals, patterns, and current state.

- **Intermediate Goal:** Plan and build out the directory structure in `project-template-build-out-meta-wip/.ai-context/` with two main sections: `for-humans/` (instructions for humans) and `for-robots/` (files for AI agents to read). Renamed main folder to `ai-context-management/`.

- **Current Task:** Keep meta status tracking current and maintain selective mirror-sync for shared system docs, while preserving meta-specific `current-work/` and `project-setup/` content.
