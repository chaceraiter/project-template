# Past Chat Record Process

This folder stores archived chat records that preserve decisions and work history.

## Save Location

Put records in this directory:

`ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/`

## Filename Format

Use:

`YYYY-MM-DD-<tool>-<short-topic>.md`

Examples:
- `2026-02-11-cursor-context-backlog.md`
- `2026-02-11-claude-debugging-hand-off.md`

## What Goes Here

- Full transcript exports when available
- Structured chat summaries when full export is not practical
- Dated handoff notes that capture key decisions and next steps

## Required Follow-Up

After adding a chat record, update:

1. `ai-context-management/for-robots/current-work/current-context-for-new-chat.md`
2. `ai-context-management/for-robots/current-work/current-work-focus.md` if focus changed
