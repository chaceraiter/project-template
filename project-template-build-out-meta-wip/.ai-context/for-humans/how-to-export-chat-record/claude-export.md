# Exporting Chats from Claude

First read `record-format-standard.md` in this folder.

## Method 1: Copy Conversation (Most Common)
1. Open the conversation in Claude (claude.ai or Claude app)
2. Select all text (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A)
3. Copy (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into a file in `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/`
5. Use filename format from `record-format-standard.md`

## Method 2: Built-In Export/Share (If Available)
1. Check for Download/Share/Export actions in conversation UI
2. Export if available
3. Save to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/` with standard naming

## Method 3: Structured Summary (Fallback)
Use this when a complete transcript is unavailable:
1. Write a structured summary using required sections in `record-format-standard.md`
2. Save it to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/` with standard naming

## After Export

Follow the required post-export updates in `record-format-standard.md` so current context stays accurate.
