# Exporting Chats from GitHub Copilot

First read `record-format-standard.md` in this folder.

## Method 1: Copy from IDE Chat Panel
1. Open the Copilot chat panel in your IDE
2. Select all messages (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A)
3. Copy (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into a file in `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/`
5. Use filename format from `record-format-standard.md`

## Method 2: Account/Platform History (If Available)
1. Check GitHub/Copilot settings for chat history or export
2. Export if available
3. Save selected conversation content to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/` with standard naming

## Method 3: Structured Summary (Fallback)
Use this when full transcript export is not practical:
1. Write a structured summary using required sections in `record-format-standard.md`
2. Save it to `ai-context-management/for-robots/past-chat-record/` with standard naming

## After Export

Follow the required post-export updates in `record-format-standard.md` so current context stays accurate.
